## SQL Analysis & Findings

### 1. What are the best-selling products?
* **Finding:** The analysis reveals a key difference between sales volume and sales value. By total **quantity sold**, the top product is "Camembert Pierrot". However, when analyzing by total **sales revenue**, the most valuable product is "CÃ´te de Blaye". This insight shows that our highest revenue-generating products are not necessarily the ones we sell most often.

### 2. Who are the top-performing sales representatives?

### 3. What was the monthly sales trend for 1997?
* **Finding:** Sales in 1997 followed a clear seasonal trend. They started slow in the first quarter and grew steadily throughout the year, reaching a peak in the final quarter.
* **Script:** [`03_monthly_sales_1997.sql`](./sql_scripts/03_monthly_sales_1997.sql)

### 4. Who are the most valuable customers?
* **Finding:** Our most valuable customers by total spending are primarily located in Germany and Austria. The top two companies, "QUICK-Stop" and "Ernst Handel", are responsible for a substantial portion of total revenue, making them key accounts for retention efforts.
